The project was well out of my degree's syllabus scope, as it covered various concepts such as multi-threading, parallel-processing, electrical signals and Single Board Computers. I developed two main programs; the G-Code Interpreter, and the Interpolation program. These two programs work together to drive an industry-grade Computerised Numerical Control (CNC) machine, which was connected to the Raspberry Pi's pins. \",\"main\":\"A digital image is first converted into a G-Code using a Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) softwares. I would then execute the G-code Interpreter that reads this G-Code file and translate it into a signal file, which is basically a file containing numbers. The Interpolation Program then takes this signal file to produce electrical pulses that drives the CNC machine to move a pen attached to it and draw the digital image on a piece of paper.\",\"technology\":\"The execution of this project exposed myself to an extensive amount of linux commands, since Raspberry Pi runs the Raspbian OS, which is based on Linux. I also did all developments on a seperate machine running Linux Debian. Development wise, the two programs were written heavily in C++/C++11. Parallel processing and multi-threading had to be implemented as signals need to be generated concurrently to the CNC machine's servo motors. I was also exposed to various Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) softwares, such as AutoCAD and PyCAM respectively.\",\"results\":\"The end product of this project opened my eyes to the power of Software Engineering, as those two programs I wrote actually drove the CNC machine to draw images on a piece of paper. Some mathematics was involved as well, hence I was very happy and blown away to see those numbers work together to produce real results. The full report/thesis for this project is available upon request.\",\"videos\":[\"\",\"\",\"\"]},\"chatbot\":{\"title\":\"A Chatbot to Facilitate Data Analysis\",\"time\":\"TBC 2020\",\"intro\":\"This is my MSc Project, in which I will be building a chatbot designed to faciliate Big Data preparation by helping users to choose the appropriate pipeline functions based on a set of predefined questions and answers.

We spent around two(2) months for the completion of this full end-to-end, design-to-deploy development project. The pages are responsive as well as optimised for mobile experience as well.\",\"main\":\"The webpage was first designed using Figma, a web design software, similar to Sketch. There were data going in and out of this webpage, hence we kept things as simple as possible and focues primarily on its front-end design and feel.\",\"technology\":\"The core technology underlining this project was plain HTML, CSS3, but we implmented things in a full-stack way, except that we did not connect a database : NodeJS and Express in the backend, JQuery for DOM manipulation, and Ajax for optimisation. For deployment, we used Heroku, and purchased a domain from a Domain Provider. We also used Github to keep track of the code changes and versioning.\",\"results\":\"The end product of this project was a minimalistic but filled with the essential information that would keep track of my wife's past experiences and work portfolio. One way to improve this website is to implement new technologies such GatsbyJS or NextJS to improve the performance and speed of this website further. Another improvement is to abstract away data components of the website from the development code, hence enhancing software maintainability.\"},\"ultimatePort\":{\"title\":\"My Portfolio\",\"time\":\"TBC 2020\",\"intro\":\"This could be my own portfolio that stores all my acadmic and professional records, but what I designed it to be much more than just that. I designed it to also store useful contents that users can visit and learn a thing or two, and then share them if they think some of the articles might be useful. I aim to complete this project by the end of 2020. Therefore, this webpage shall be updated further as the project completes.\",\"main\":\"Some of the other contents that may be useful for the users include my travel blog, which could store and share my travel experiences around the world. We aim to provide feedback and opinions on for example the flight, accommodation, activities, and overall experiences, so users could read and make necessary preparations should they plan to travel to the same places as we did.\",\"technology\":\"For this project, I implemented NextJS, providing server-side rendering technology for fast browsing experience. At the point of writing this there is no need for a database connection, but this may subject to change. It would also be deployed on to heroku.\",\"results\":\"The result of this project is yet to be descibed, once the project is finished.\"},\"wedding\":{\"title\":\"Wedding Planning System\",\"link\":\"http://www.asyrulmarriesyasmin.com\",\"time\":\"2018\",\"intro\":\"Planning a wedding is not an easy task, especially when we have various tasks delegated amongst our own family members. The aim for this project was to help planning a wedding easier, by registering all required tasks into the system, and each task is monitored or managed by one person. This was my first full-stack web development project,, after I enrolled in a course called the Web Developer Bootcamp (Udemy), and completed the whole 46-hour video course to gain all the necessary knowledge.\",\"main\":\"This project covers a wide range of web development topics, such as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Authentication, Authorisation, Database, Express, and Deployment. Users are able to create a task, and assign this task to an individual. For each of these tasks, there is a page for them, where users can comment and do some minor discussion regarding the topic. The owner of the task, i.e. the person the task was assigned to, is able to delete/remove comments, and the progress in the task description, as well as to update the 'progress bar'.\",\"technology\":\"This project covers all aspect of a CRUD application (Create, Read, Update and Delete). I used NodeJS, Express, MongoDB and Bootstrap. I deployed it on Heroku, but for the development environment I used the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud 9. GitHub was also used for source tracking.\",\"results\":\"The result of this project is full-fledged NodeJS application that allows users to log in, create a task, update their tasks, comment, delete and so on. The website also contains any relevant information related to the wedding, such as the map, the invitation card, and to monitor the number of guests. One way this project could have been improved is by implementing a Front-End framework, such as Angular or ReactJS.\"},\"funfactory\":{\"title\":\"Kindergarten Website\",\"time\":\"TBC 2020\",\"intro\":\"For this project I will be building a website for a Kindergarten Business owned by my mother-in-law. The sole purpose of this website is to provide necessary information about the business, as well as to provide contact information for potential customers.
