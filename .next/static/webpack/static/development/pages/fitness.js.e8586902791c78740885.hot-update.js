I was weak, have never exceled in any athletic event or sport, and finally injured myself as I twisted my knee during house practice at school when I was just 13 years old. This was probably due to my highly-inactive lifestyle, besides also being born in a family which do not practice physical exercise as weekly (even monthly) routines. That gradually changed after I was introduced to my brother in law, Dr. Daniel, who occasionally would invite me to join him for runs. At that time, 1 mile/1.5KM was enough to kill me. You can see Dr. Daniel in the photo below wearing red jersey. As I established myself with some stable allowances, I signed up for a gym and began my journey of knowledge.\",\"main1\":\"Throughout the years, I have tried various fitness programs ranging from endurance, strength and hypertrophy. However, my primary interest is mainly on hypertrophy training. These photos you see below did not take three or even six months of commitment, but a few years. Some say that fitness is a journey, not a destination - setting yourself a 3-month time frame to achieve a goal which in reality takes many years of training will essentially get you nowhere.\",\"main2\":\"To tell you that I figured out how to properly build muscle and burn fat on day 1 of training is definitely going to be a lie. It took me around 2-3 years to finally understand how the human body works, in regards with muscular development and fat catabolism. The photos you see below depict my physical tranformation over the past years, as I proved time and time again that my fat loss methodology worked. No drugs, just knowledge and willpower.\",\"maintenance\":\"As part of my effort to maintain the muscle mass I have naturally attained over the years, I normally hit the gym around 2-3 times a week. Most men would agree that the after-marriage phase of life is normally the most challenging when it comes to staying in shape, yet alone keeping up with the intense training schedules. Nevertheless, I managed to stay disciplined even after I got married, well at least for a couple of months, after which my goals in life gradually changed as I became older and more matured.\",\"closure\":\"As the days go by, my fitness goals slowly shifted from 'get big and strong' to just 'stay fit and healthy', which to me, serves a much healthier purpose in other aspects of life, those of which I have sacrificed for many years, such as family and friends relationship, travelling the world, and of course, improving my competency as a life-long software engineer. That being said, with the knowledge and experience I have gained over the years, if I ever feel like I am 'out-of-shape' I am 120% confident that I can always train and get myself back into shape.\"},\"race\":{\"title\":\"Participation in Various Race Events\",\"time\":\"2014-2018\",\"intro\":\"Given my highly-inactive lifestyle since my younger days, long distance running always seemed like an impossible task for me. In fact, running for 1 mile (1.5 KM) was enough to put myself at a complete fatigue. Nevertheless, as I grew older and began exposing myself to more cardiovascular-intensive workouts, I finally decided to get involved in long distance running events. The first of these events was the Cyberjaya Twin City Marathon, organised back in 2014, in which I took part in the 14KM category with my friends. It was indeed such a huge achievement for me as I was able to run 14KMs without stopping to catch a breath. I then proceeded to train and participate for a more challenging event, which was the Standard Chartered Half Marathon (21KM) in 2016.\",\"main1\":\"The Viper challenge was an obstacle run event in  which there are two categories: 5KM and 11KM. Yasmin and I took part in the 5KM category, having to go through a total of 6 obstacles. It was fun overall and can get tough if you are not good with pullups (which I was hehe).\",\"main2\":\"My wife and I also took part in the 5KM category of Color Run organised by CIMB in 2017. It was not much for the challenge but more for the fun of it. Overall, it was alright.\",\"main3\":\"The SCHKM was the peak of my running event participation. Being someone who trains muscle strength and hypertrophy, hitting that endurance muscle fibers certainly gave me a painful yet satisfying experience.\",\"closure\":\"Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.
