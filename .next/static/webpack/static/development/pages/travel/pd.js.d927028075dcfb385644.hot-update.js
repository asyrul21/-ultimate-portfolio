Port Dickson, or PD has been one of the go-to places for Malaysians to get a quick getaway from the busy city lifestyle. There are beaches as well, luxurious hotels and tasty seafood restaurants. For this trip, we did not pay for any package whatsoever, our plan was to relax and enjoy the beach and maybe try out some fun activities provided by the hotel.\",\"transport\":\"We got to PD by car, and by the time I started driving, it was already night time.\",\"accommodation\":\"We stayed at the Grand Lexis for another 4 days and 3 nights. The Grand Lexis are generally known for their private pools which was what brought us to stay in one of their rooms. Besides their beautiful\",\"day1\":\"We arrived at our hotel late at night, thus on the first day all we did was settle down and sleep. The next day, we spent most of our time swimming in the indoor swimming pool, and relaxing in the room. In the afternoon, we went out for a bicycle ride, catch some nice views, relaxed at the nearby beach, and rode the Segway.\",\"day2\":\"On the next day afternoon we decided to fly kite. The last time I flew kite was so many years ago, back when I was still a child. It was not a very windy day, so it was quite a challenge for us to properly get the kite high up in the sky. However, we managed to to get the kite high enough in the end, although just for a while. After we that, we got some Milo-flavoured Ice Kepal from a nearby stall, a type of desert which I have never tried in my life. Overall, we had a quite a fun afternoon! Later that evening we had dinner at this restaurant called Seaview which is a terrific seafood restaurant, although it can get quite expensive.\",\"conclusion\":\"Our trip to PD was not meant to be packed with various activities, since we have already done quite a lot during our Krabi trip, which was immediately prior to this. It was more of a relax-and-chill sort of vacation. We also lunch at this place called the .., which I highly recommend!\",\"videos\":[\"https://youtu.be/g23uujAncgg\",\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OESBTYBT0A\",\"https://youtu.be/4s94wy6ZGJE\"]}");
