The project was well out of my degree's syllabus scope, as it covered various concepts such as multi-threading, parallel-processing, electrical signals and Single Board Computers. I developed two main programs; the G-Code Interpreter, and the Interpolation program. These two programs work together to drive an industry-grade Computerised Numerical Control (CNC) machine, which was connected to the Raspberry Pi's pins. \",\"transport\":\"We went by fllight Malaysian Airlines. it was good nice food. Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the\",\"accommodation\":\"Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.

I would then execute the G-code Interpreter that reads this G-Code file and translate it into a signal file, which is basically a file containing numbers. The Interpolation Program then takes this signal file to produce electrical pulses that drives the CNC machine to move a pen attached to it and draw the digital image on a piece of paper.\",\"day2\":\"The execution of this project exposed me to an great amount of linux commands, since Raspberry Pi runs the Raspbian OS, which is based on Linux. I also did all developments on a seperate machine running Linux Debian. Development-wise, the two programs were written heavily in C++/C++11. Parallel processing and multi-threading had to be implemented as signals need to be generated concurrently to the CNC machine's servo motors. I was also exposed to various Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) softwares, such as AutoCAD and PyCAM respectively.\",\"conclusion\":\"The end product of this project opened my eyes to the power of Software Engineering, as those two programs I wrote actually drove the CNC machine to draw images on a piece of paper. Some mathematics was involved as well, hence I was very happy and blown away to see those numbers work together to produce real results. The full report/thesis for this project is available upon request.\",\"videos\":[\"https://youtu.be/g23uujAncgg\",\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OESBTYBT0A\",\"https://youtu.be/4s94wy6ZGJE\"]}");
