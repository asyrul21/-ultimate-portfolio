Port Dickson, or PD has been one of the go-to places for Malaysians to get a quick getaway from the busy city lifestyle. There are beaches as well, luxurious hotels and tasty seafood restaurants. For this trip, we did not pay for any package whatsoever, our plan was to relax and enjoy the beach and maybe try out some fun activities provided by the hotel.\",\"transport\":\"We went by fllight Malaysian Airlines. it was good nice food. Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.

I would then execute the G-code Interpreter that reads this G-Code file and translate it into a signal file, which is basically a file containing numbers. The Interpolation Program then takes this signal file to produce electrical pulses that drives the CNC machine to move a pen attached to it and draw the digital image on a piece of paper.\",\"day2\":\"The execution of this project exposed me to an great amount of linux commands, since Raspberry Pi runs the Raspbian OS, which is based on Linux. I also did all developments on a seperate machine running Linux Debian. Development-wise, the two programs were written heavily in C++/C++11. Parallel processing and multi-threading had to be implemented as signals need to be generated concurrently to the CNC machine's servo motors. I was also exposed to various Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) softwares, such as AutoCAD and PyCAM respectively.\",\"conclusion\":\"The end product of this project opened my eyes to the power of Software Engineering, as those two programs I wrote actually drove the CNC machine to draw images on a piece of paper. Some mathematics was involved as well, hence I was very happy and blown away to see those numbers work together to produce real results. The full report/thesis for this project is available upon request.\",\"videos\":[\"https://youtu.be/g23uujAncgg\",\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OESBTYBT0A\",\"https://youtu.be/4s94wy6ZGJE\"]}");
