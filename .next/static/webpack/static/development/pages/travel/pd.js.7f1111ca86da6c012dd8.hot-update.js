Port Dickson, or PD has been one of the go-to places for Malaysians to get a quick getaway from the busy city lifestyle. There are beaches as well, luxurious hotels and tasty seafood restaurants. For this trip, we did not pay for any package whatsoever, our plan was to relax and enjoy the beach and maybe try out some fun activities provided by the hotel.\",\"transport\":\"We got to PD by car, and by the time I started driving, it was already night time.\",\"accommodation\":\"We stayed at the Grand Lexis for another 4 days and 3 nights. The Grand Lexis are generally known for their private pools which was what brought us to stay in one of their rooms. Besides their beautiful\",\"day1\":\"We arrived at our hotel late at night, thus on the first day all we did was settle down and sleep. The next day, we spent most of our time swimming in the indoor swimming pool, and relaxing in the room. In the afternoon, we went out for a bicycle ride, catch some nice views, relaxed at the nearby beach, and rode the Segway.\",\"day2\":\"The execution of this project exposed me to an great amount of linux commands, since Raspberry Pi runs the Raspbian OS, which is based on Linux. I also did all developments on a seperate machine running Linux Debian. Development-wise, the two programs were written heavily in C++/C++11. Parallel processing and multi-threading had to be implemented as signals need to be generated concurrently to the CNC machine's servo motors. I was also exposed to various Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) softwares, such as AutoCAD and PyCAM respectively.\",\"conclusion\":\"The end product of this project opened my eyes to the power of Software Engineering, as those two programs I wrote actually drove the CNC machine to draw images on a piece of paper. Some mathematics was involved as well, hence I was very happy and blown away to see those numbers work together to produce real results. The full report/thesis for this project is available upon request.\",\"videos\":[\"https://youtu.be/g23uujAncgg\",\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OESBTYBT0A\",\"https://youtu.be/4s94wy6ZGJE\"]}");
