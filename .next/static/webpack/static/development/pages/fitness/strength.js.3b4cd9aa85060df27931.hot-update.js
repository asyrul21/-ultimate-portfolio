I engaged purely with the intention of becoming stronger, to be able to lift heavier weights (because why not!). Strength programs have had countless of benefits, and I sure did experienced them first hand. You learn to become very comfortable at those difficult (particularly  for beginners) lifts: Bench Press, Squats, Deadlifts and Military Shoulder Press. These four exercises are incredibly, if not the most effective when it comes to not only building strength, but building muscle mass as well. To tell you the truth, my body grew both stronger and bigger far way faster than when it did when I was training Hypertrophy. Strength programs also teach you discipline when it comes to lifting weights with proper form. Beginners (including myself) who start their fitness journey with Hyertrophy usually would have poor form when executing those four lifts, but improve greatly as they engage in Strength Programs.\"},\"keyidea\":{\"title\":\"Key Concepts\",\"text\":\"The main idea is to train AT MAXIMUM 4-5 workouts for each body part, with each workout having 3-4 sets. I have met people who trained 8 workouts for chest, and I can assure you that by doing so, you are only wasting your time. Try to keep sets around 3-4, and reps around 8-12, although it is always recommended to change things up to 'shock' the muscle by either increasing your intensity(weight) and reducing reps (down to 6), but slightly increasing rest time, or lowering the weight and hit up to 16 repetitions. In general, we aim to train each major muscle groups of each body part every week, incorporating compound movements as a highest priority. Finally, for an average Joe like me, time is gold. Hence, aim to complete your workout around 60-90 minutes, any longer than this your workouts would be less efficient, although for Strength training you do need to train longer, due to the longer rest. Notice that in the beginning of each workout, I include a 10-15 minutes of light cardio warmups. THIS IS IMPORTANT. Notice as well at the start of every upper body workout I included an optional pullup training using max effort. This was how I maintained my pullup repetitions up (around 10-12). In my experience, pulldowns does not help with your pullup strength.\"},\"fivebyfive\":{\"title\":\"The Upper Lower Split\",\"link\":\"https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/upper-lower-4-day-gym-bodybuilding-workout\",\"text\":\"The main idea of the Upper-Lower split is to train upper body on one day, and train legs on the next. Then rest for one day, then do an alternate version of your upper body routine on the next day, followed by an alternate version of your legs routine on the day after. Then rest for 2 days. You can also do light cardio on one of the 2 rest days. So in a week you would do: Upper -> Lower -> Rest -> Upper(alt) -> Lower(alt) -> rest -> rest. For each body part, we only train 1 (at most 2) major workouts. Hence, your are basically hitting the same body part twice in a week. And yes, in this program you train legs twice in a week, which is probably why most people in the gym refuse to commit to a more effective program such as this one, and almost always going for the bro split. One suggestion of each routine can be found below. If you are not sure how to perform any of these workouts, please search them on Google or Youtube.\"},\"texasmethod\":{\"title\":\"The Push Pull Leg Split\",\"link\":\"https://builtwithscience.com/push-pull-legs-routine/\",\"text\":\"This routine is another one of those scientifically-proven-to-be-effective programs out there. You are able to train with either a three days per week routine, or a six days per week (in case you decide to get more serious). For the three-day routine, you have the push workout for one day, then rest on the next, then pull day, then rest, and so on. So in a week, it would be something like Push -> Rest -> Pull -> Rest -> Legs -> rest -> rest. For the six days routine on the other hand, it would look something like Push -> Pull -> Leg -> Rest -> Push -> Pull -> Leg, with the second push-pull-leg cycle being the alternate and lighter version of the first. One suggestion for each of this routines are as below. You can also alternate the original Push -> Pull -> Leg with their alternate versions on a weekly basis if you plan to train three days a week. Again, If you are not sure how to perform any of these workouts, please search them on Google or Youtube. (IMPORTANT): Perform deadlifts only if you are able to do it in good form. Warm up your deads with light weight, then work your way up to 1-2 heavy sets. If the last sentence you read does not make sense to you, its best to skip it altogether.\"},\"closure\":\"No matter what split you are on, the most important thing is to commit yourself to the training routine. This is why it is crucial to pick a sustainable split program based on your daily activities. Picking a 6-days a week PPL split when you're just starting out and having a 9am-9pm job is certainly not a very good idea, as you will end up burnt out and breaking your commitment way too quickly. Start things out slowly (for example a 2-day a week U/L split), then slowly build your commitment up to the desired level (4-day U/L or 6-day PPL or 5-day Bro Split - that is, IF you want to). Also, remember to switch things up every now and then. Performing the same workouts and the same split for more than three months could hinder muscular growth. Most importantly, remember to keep your food intake on point, which I will be talking about in the Diet section. Without proper nutrition, your time in the gym may all be completely wasted.\"}");
