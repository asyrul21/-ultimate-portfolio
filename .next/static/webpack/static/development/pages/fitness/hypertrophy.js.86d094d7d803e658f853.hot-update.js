In scientific terms, this is called Hypertrophy. Contrary to popular belief, a good hypertrophy training does not necessarily mean training with heavier weights. Weights should be light enough for you to lift around 8-12 repetitions (reps) for 3-4 sets. This is the biggest mistake new lifters usually make: lifting with a weight that is too heavy for them to execute with proper form. I admit to have done this mistake myself, which affected my optimal growth in the first few months(or perhaps years). The body does not care about the numbers on your metal plate, it only knows intensity. Hence, before you decide to start training, leave your ego out the door. I have engaged in various training programs, but three have become my favourite, due to their effectiveness on my body: The Upper/Lower split, the Push Pull Leg, and the all-time favourite, the famous/infamous 'Bro' Split.\"},\"keyidea\":{\"title\":\"Key Concepts\",\"text\":\"The main idea is to train AT MAXIMUM 4-5 workouts for each body part, with each workout having 3-4 sets. I have met people who trained 8 workouts for chest, and I can assure you that by doing so, you are only wasting your time. Try to keep sets around 3-4, and reps around 8-12, although it is always recommended to change things up to 'shock' the muscle by either increasing your intensity(weight) and reducing reps (down to 6), but slightly increasing rest time, or lowering the weight and hit up to 16 repetitions. In general, we aim to train each major muscle groups of each body part every week, incorporating compound movements as a highest priority. Finally, for an average Joe like me, time is gold. Hence, aim to complete your workout around 60-90 minutes, any longer than this your workouts would be less efficient, although for Strength training you do need to train longer, due to the longer rest. Notice that in the beginning of each workout, I include a 10-15 minutes of light cardio warmups. THIS IS IMPORTANT. Notice as well at the start of every upper body workout I included an optional pullup training using max effort. This was how I maintained my pullup repetitions up (around 10-12). In my experience, pulldowns does not help with your pullup strength.\"},\"upperlower\":{\"title\":\"The Upper Lower Split\",\"link\":\"https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/upper-lower-4-day-gym-bodybuilding-workout\",\"text\":\"The main idea of the Upper-Lower split is to train upper body on one day, and train legs on the next. Then rest for one day, then do an alternate version of your upper body routine on the next day, followed by an alternate version of your legs routine on the day after. Then rest for 2 days. You can also do light cardio on one of the 2 rest days. So in a week you would do: Upper -> Lower -> Rest -> Upper(alt) -> Lower(alt) -> rest -> rest. For each body part, we only train 1 (at most 2) major workouts. Hence, your are basically hitting the same body part twice in a week. And yes, in this program you train legs twice in a week, which is probably why most people in the gym refuse to commit to a more effective program such as this one, and almost always going for the bro split. One suggestion of each routine can be found below. If you are not sure how to perform any of these workouts, please search them on Google or Youtube.\"},\"pushpull\":{\"title\":\"The Push Pull Leg Split\",\"link\":\"https://builtwithscience.com/push-pull-legs-routine/\",\"text\":\"This routine is another one of those scientifically-proven-to-be-effective programs out there. You are able to train with either a three days per week routine, or a six days per week (in case you decide to get more serious). For the three-day routine, you have the push workout for one day, then rest on the next, then pull day, then rest, and so on. So in a week, it would be something like Push -> Rest -> Pull -> Rest -> Legs -> rest -> rest. For the six days routine on the other hand, it would look something like Push -> Pull -> Leg -> Rest -> Push -> Pull -> Leg, with the second push-pull-leg cycle being the alternate and lighter version of the first. One suggestion for each of this routines are as below. You can also alternate the original Push -> Pull -> Leg with their alternate versions on a weekly basis if you plan to train three days a week. Again, If you are not sure how to perform any of these workouts, please search them on Google or Youtube. (IMPORTANT): Perform deadlifts only if you are able to do it in good form. Warm up your deads with light weight, then work your way up to 1-2 heavy sets. If the last sentence you read does not make sense to you, its best to skip it altogether.\"},\"brosplit\":{\"title\":\"The Bro Split\",\"link\":\"http://www.google.com\",\"text\":\"For those that do not already know, the 'Bro' split is the one where you only train one body part per day of training. Based on my experience, the 'Bro Split '\"},\"closure\":\"Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.
