In scientific terms, this is called Hypertrophy. Contrary to popular belief, a good hypertrophy training does not necessarily mean training with heavier weights. Weights should be light enough for you to lift for around 8-12 reps for 3-4 sets.

I admit to have done this mistake myself, which affected my optimal growth in the first few months. The body does not care about the numbers on your metal plate, it only knows intensity. Hence, before you decide to start training, leave the ego out the door.\"},\"keyidea\":{\"title\":\"Key Concept\",\"text\":\"Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.
