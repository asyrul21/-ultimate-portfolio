Besides helping you to look leaner and better, fat-loss programs train your mind, you patience, and of course, your cooking skills (because abs are made in the kitchen arn't they?). Moreover, becoming lean helps you run better, gain better endurance, and become a generally healthier person. Now I have heard countless of times people saying they want to start 'cutting' or lose fat, but just after 2 weeks of commitment, they gave up. Why? 1) They do not practice proper nutrition. 2) They got too excited and trained too hard in the beginning. 3) They simply do not know how to do it, and they refuse to seek knowledge. As mentioned, an effective cut requires perserverance, patience, discipline, humility in knowledge and will. Without any of these, not a single Fat Burner pill will be able to help you to lose fat.\"},\"keyidea\":{\"title\":\"Key Concepts\",\"text\":\"There is only one primary objective of any fat-loss program, that is to bring the athlete's heart rate up, and then keep it there. How? By either raising it up higher though anarobic exercises, or keep them at a particular rate through aerobic exercises. Depending on your circumstances, you may need to apply different approaches towards selecting your fat-loss workouts. For example, it does not make sense if you have just completed a 90-minute intense leg day and after that going for a HIIT workout. In that case, you are better off with a steady state cardio (SSC) either to warm down, or to keep your heart rate at a certain level. Right, so how do we know that we are doing a good job during a fat-loss training? A good sign of when your heart rate is increasing is that you are panting to get more oxygen into the body. Secondly, you are sweating like you are taking a shower (as you 'burn' fat, it is catabolised into water - in the form of sweat and urine - and energy). Hence, if you plan to torch fat but your workout sessions barely make you sweat, you would not make any progress. In this page we will look at four of my favourite and go-to's fat-loss programs; the High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), High Intensity Cardio, Circuits and the Barbell Complex.\"},\"hiit\":{\"title\":\"High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)\",\"link\":\"https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a25424850/best-hiit-exercises-workout/\",\"text\":\"The High Intensit Interval Training (HIIT), involves the idea of 'intervals' to raise the heart rate of the athlete. The intervals are often written as n:m, where n is the time given to work, and m is time given to rest. For example, a 1:4 running interval training on the treadmill would require the athlete to run for 1 minute and rest (slow down or walk) for 4 minutes. This interval is then repeated for a specific number of sets, usually 8-10 but as manay as you want. To increase intensity, you can change this interval ratio. 1:1 would be more challenging than 1:4 due to the lower rest time, and 2:1 would definitely the most challenging out of the three. \"},\"hicardio\":{\"title\":\"High Intensity Cardio\",\"link\":\"https://www.t-nation.com/training/texas-method\",\"text\":\"The other strength program that I tried was the Texas Method, which was designed more towards intermediate strength athletes. Unlike 5x5, this program aims for a PR (Personal Record) by lifting slightly heavier weight on a weekly basis, instead of on every session. You also need to do some calculations to get the numbers you need to train with. Though the calculation part may be a bit tricky, this program was the one that helped me achieve my humble, lifelong strength goals - Squats at 120KG for 3RM, Bench Press at 115KG for 1RM, Overhead Press at 80KG for 1RM, and Deadlift 160KG for 1RM. Although these numbers are not as high as you would expect, but as I mentioned earlier, my primary goal was Hypertrophy, and these numbers were indeed an achievenement for myself. In the Texas method, training sessions are divided into three days: the volume day, the active recovery day, and the PR day. Just like in 5x5, training sessions for weeks A and B are slightly different, both of which you need to alternate as you progress.\"},\"circuits\":{\"title\":\"Circuit Training\",\"link\":\"https://stronglifts.com/5x5/#Plateaus\",\"text\":\"Any strength program, no matter how good they may be, could not possibly stop the human body's improvement from stalling. Stalling means your progress hits a 'plateu' which limits you from progressing and adding more weight. For example, in 5x5, you may find yourself not be able to do 5 sets of 5 reps after, let's say, 10 weeks of training. Or, in the Texas Method, if you are unable to hit new PRs every week. Stalling can be dealt with many ways. First is called Deloading. Deloading is when you take some weight off your work set, then gradually rebuild your strength back up to (and beyond) the point of plateu. For example, let's say you're doing 5x5 and on one Monday you are unable to hit 100KG of Squat for 5 sets of 5 repetitions. One way to deal with this is to deload, meaning bringing down the load of your work set, say 80KG, then restart the training from there as usual. One thing to note is to only deload the workouts which you failed to get the desired sets/reps. The second approach is to modify slightly your strength program. As mentioned, in strength training we attempt to keep the volume of the workout sufficiently high, whilst lifting heavy weight. Hence, instead of lifting 5x5, try and do 8x3 instead, for a few weeks. Since the total volumes are almost the same, the total work done by the lifter at the end of the day should be relatively similar. Finally, you can also try to lengthen the frequency of progress. Instead of improving every session in 5x5, try to improve every week (i.e. the Madcow Program). If you cannot lift heavier on a weekly basis, try to add weight on every fortnight instead, and so on. A few things you should NOT do when stalling include continuing lifting with poor form and reducing range of motion.\"},\"bbcomplex\":{\"title\":\"The Barbell Complex\",\"link\":\"https://stronglifts.com/5x5/#Plateaus\",\"text\":\"Any strength program, no matter how good they may be, could not possibly stop the human body's improvement from stalling.

This is why it is crucial to pick a sustainable split program based on your daily activities. Picking a 6-days a week PPL split when you're just starting out and having a 9am-9pm job is certainly not a very good idea, as you will end up burnt out and breaking your commitment way too quickly. Start things out slowly (for example a 2-day a week U/L split), then slowly build your commitment up to the desired level (4-day U/L or 6-day PPL or 5-day Bro Split - that is, IF you want to). Also, remember to switch things up every now and then. Performing the same workouts and the same split for more than three months could hinder muscular growth. Most importantly, remember to keep your food intake on point, which I will be talking about in the Diet section. Without proper nutrition, your time in the gym may all be completely wasted.\"}");
