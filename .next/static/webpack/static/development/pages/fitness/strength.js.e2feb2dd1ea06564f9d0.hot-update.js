I engaged purely with the intention of becoming stronger, to be able to lift heavier weights (because why not!). Strength programs have had countless of benefits, and I sure did experienced them first hand. You learn to become very comfortable at those difficult (particularly  for beginners) lifts: Bench Press, Squats, Deadlifts and Military Shoulder Press. These four exercises are incredibly, if not the most effective when it comes to not only building strength, but building muscle mass as well. To tell you the truth, my body grew both stronger and bigger far way faster than it did when I was training Hypertrophy. Strength programs also teach you discipline when it comes to lifting weights with proper form. Beginners (including myself) who start their fitness journey with Hyertrophy usually would have poor form when executing those four lifts, but improve greatly as they engage in Strength Programs. Finally, thanks to these Strength programs, I was able to achieve my lifelong strength goals, which would otherwise take much longer if I were to only stuck with Hypertrophy training. The two strength training programs that I  tried were the 5x5 and the Texas Method.\"},\"keyidea\":{\"title\":\"Key Concepts\",\"text\":\"If you are already familiar with Hypertrophy, you would recall that generally, you would perform 3 (sometimes 4) sets of 8 to 12 repetitions for each workout. If you perform 3 sets of 8, we say that the 'volume' of the workout is 3x8=24. In strength training, the general idea is to attempt to keep this volume the same, but with much heavier weights. This is done by reducing the reps, and increasing the sets, with rest times increased to at least 3 minutes. For example, in the 5x5 program, we perform 5 sets of 5 reps, giving us the volume of 5x5=25, almost similar to the volume of the 3x8 in Hypertrophy. The case is the same if the lifter decides to lifter heaver, now for 3 repetitions, he would then need to perform 8 sets to keep the volume sufficiently high (8x3=24). Nevertheless, this concept only applies on 'volume days' of the lifter's strength programs, and there may be cases where lifters would lift more or less than the total volume mentioned here. Note that there are so many strength programs out there, most of which are much better when engaged a personal strength coach, which I highly recommend. Start your programs with relatively lightweight, then gradually add weight as the program progresses. Also note that due to the long rest times and intensity, strength training sessions usually take longer to complete as compared to Hypertrophy. Besides that, optimal strength training critically requires sufficient rest and nutrition for proper progression.\"},\"fivebyfive\":{\"title\":\"The 5 x 5\",\"link\":\"https://stronglifts.com/5x5/\",\"text\":\"In 5x5, you only execute three, yep you read that right, THREE workouts in each training session. These workouts are chosen based on the program's schedule, which you could see below. Of course, today there are many other variations to the program, but the schedule you see below is the generic one (and the one that did I as well, which contributed to my massive strength and size gains). In each session, you attempt to perform 5 sets of 5 repetition of a given workout, using weights that are 5lbs(about 2.5KG) heavier than those used in the previous session. Yep, you lift heavier on EACH SESSION, which makes this program very much suitable for beginners, as beginners generally improve much faster as compared to seasoned lifters. For example, if on monday you perform Squats with a total of 60KG, then on the next session (Wednesday), you are supposed to Squat 62.5KG, then on Friday 65KG and so on. For this reason it is crucial to 1) Pick a starting weight that you are very comfortable with. 2)Get enough food and sleep. As you may already have imagined, you will gain strength and lift heavier weights by each session, and will grow at a tremendous speed, well that is, until you 'stall'. Stalling is when you are unable to execute 5 sets of 5 repetitions anymore as you reach a certain weight. Stalling is normal and there are ways to deal with stalling as we will see later. Below you can find the 3-days a week program, with weeks A and B slightly different of each other, and which you have to alternate on each week, as you progress. For example, Week A -> Week B -> Week A -> Week B and so on.\"},\"texasmethod\":{\"title\":\"The Texas Method\",\"link\":\"https://www.t-nation.com/training/texas-method\",\"text\":\"The other strength program that I tried was the Texas Method, which was designed more towards intermediate strength athletes.\"},\"closure\":\"No matter what split you are on, the most important thing is to commit yourself to the training routine. This is why it is crucial to pick a sustainable split program based on your daily activities. Picking a 6-days a week PPL split when you're just starting out and having a 9am-9pm job is certainly not a very good idea, as you will end up burnt out and breaking your commitment way too quickly. Start things out slowly (for example a 2-day a week U/L split), then slowly build your commitment up to the desired level (4-day U/L or 6-day PPL or 5-day Bro Split - that is, IF you want to). Also, remember to switch things up every now and then. Performing the same workouts and the same split for more than three months could hinder muscular growth. Most importantly, remember to keep your food intake on point, which I will be talking about in the Diet section. Without proper nutrition, your time in the gym may all be completely wasted.\"}");
