Besides helping you to look leaner and better, fat-loss programs train your mind, you patience, and of course, your cooking skills (because abs are made in the kitchen arn't they?). Moreover, becoming lean helps you run better, gain better endurance, and become a generally healthier person. Now I have heard countless of times people saying they want to start 'cutting' or lose fat, but just after 2 weeks of commitment, they gave up. Why? 1) They do not practice proper nutrition. 2) They got too excited and trained too hard in the beginning. 3) They simply do not know how to do it, and they refuse to seek knowledge. As mentioned, an effective cut requires perserverance, patience, discipline, humility in knowledge and will. Without any of these, not a single Fat Burner pill will be able to help you to lose fat.\"},\"keyidea\":{\"title\":\"Key Concepts\",\"text\":\"If you are already familiar with Hypertrophy, you would recall that generally, you would perform 3 (sometimes 4) sets of 8 to 12 repetitions for each workout. If you perform 3 sets of 8, we say that the 'volume' of the workout is 3x8=24. In strength training, the general idea is to attempt to keep this volume the same, but with much heavier weights. This is done by reducing the reps, and increasing the sets, with rest times increased to at least 3 minutes. For example, in the 5x5 program, we perform 5 sets of 5 reps, giving us the volume of 5x5=25, almost similar to the volume of the 3x8 in Hypertrophy. The case is the same if the lifter decides to lifter heaver, now for 3 repetitions, he would then need to perform 8 sets to keep the volume sufficiently high (8x3=24). Nevertheless, this concept only applies on 'volume days' of the lifter's strength programs, and there may be cases where lifters would lift more or less than the total volume mentioned here. Note that there are so many strength programs out there, most of which are much better when engaged a personal strength coach, which I highly recommend. Start your programs with relatively lightweight, then gradually add weight as the program progresses. Also note that due to the long rest times and intensity, strength training sessions usually take longer to complete as compared to Hypertrophy. Besides that, optimal strength training critically requires sufficient rest and nutrition for proper progression.\"},\"hiit\":{\"title\":\"High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)\",\"link\":\"https://stronglifts.com/5x5/\",\"text\":\"In 5x5, you only execute three, yep you read that right, THREE workouts in each training session. These workouts are chosen based on the program's schedule, which you could see below. Of course, today there are many other variations to the program, but the schedule you see below is the generic one (and the one that did I as well, which contributed to my massive strength and size gains). In each session, you attempt to perform 5 sets of 5 repetition of a given workout, using weights that are 5lbs(about 2.5KG) heavier than those used in the previous session. Yep, you lift heavier on EACH SESSION, which makes this program very much suitable for beginners, as beginners generally improve much faster as compared to seasoned lifters. For example, if on monday you perform Squats with a total of 60KG, then on the next session (Wednesday), you are supposed to Squat 62.5KG, then on Friday 65KG and so on. For this reason it is crucial to 1) Pick a starting weight that you are very comfortable with. 2)Get enough food and sleep. As you may already have imagined, you will gain strength and lift heavier weights by each session, and will grow at a tremendous speed, well that is, until you 'stall'. Stalling is when you are unable to execute 5 sets of 5 repetitions anymore as you reach a certain weight. Stalling is normal and there are ways to deal with stalling as we will see later. Below you can find the 3-days a week program, with weeks A and B slightly different of each other, and which you have to alternate on each week, as you progress. For example, Week A -> Week B -> Week A -> Week B and so on.\"},\"hicardio\":{\"title\":\"High Intensity Cardio\",\"link\":\"https://www.t-nation.com/training/texas-method\",\"text\":\"The other strength program that I tried was the Texas Method, which was designed more towards intermediate strength athletes. Unlike 5x5, this program aims for a PR (Personal Record) by lifting slightly heavier weight on a weekly basis, instead of on every session. You also need to do some calculations to get the numbers you need to train with. Though the calculation part may be a bit tricky, this program was the one that helped me achieve my humble, lifelong strength goals - Squats at 120KG for 3RM, Bench Press at 115KG for 1RM, Overhead Press at 80KG for 1RM, and Deadlift 160KG for 1RM. Although these numbers are not as high as you would expect, but as I mentioned earlier, my primary goal was Hypertrophy, and these numbers were indeed an achievenement for myself. In the Texas method, training sessions are divided into three days: the volume day, the active recovery day, and the PR day. Just like in 5x5, training sessions for weeks A and B are slightly different, both of which you need to alternate as you progress.\"},\"circuits\":{\"title\":\"Circuit Training\",\"link\":\"https://stronglifts.com/5x5/#Plateaus\",\"text\":\"Any strength program, no matter how good they may be, could not possibly stop the human body's improvement from stalling. Stalling means your progress hits a 'plateu' which limits you from progressing and adding more weight. For example, in 5x5, you may find yourself not be able to do 5 sets of 5 reps after, let's say, 10 weeks of training. Or, in the Texas Method, if you are unable to hit new PRs every week. Stalling can be dealt with many ways. First is called Deloading. Deloading is when you take some weight off your work set, then gradually rebuild your strength back up to (and beyond) the point of plateu. For example, let's say you're doing 5x5 and on one Monday you are unable to hit 100KG of Squat for 5 sets of 5 repetitions. One way to deal with this is to deload, meaning bringing down the load of your work set, say 80KG, then restart the training from there as usual. One thing to note is to only deload the workouts which you failed to get the desired sets/reps. The second approach is to modify slightly your strength program. As mentioned, in strength training we attempt to keep the volume of the workout sufficiently high, whilst lifting heavy weight. Hence, instead of lifting 5x5, try and do 8x3 instead, for a few weeks. Since the total volumes are almost the same, the total work done by the lifter at the end of the day should be relatively similar. Finally, you can also try to lengthen the frequency of progress. Instead of improving every session in 5x5, try to improve every week (i.e. the Madcow Program). If you cannot lift heavier on a weekly basis, try to add weight on every fortnight instead, and so on. A few things you should NOT do when stalling include continuing lifting with poor form and reducing range of motion.\"},\"bbcomplex\":{\"title\":\"The Barbell Complex\",\"link\":\"https://stronglifts.com/5x5/#Plateaus\",\"text\":\"Any strength program, no matter how good they may be, could not possibly stop the human body's improvement from stalling.

This is why it is crucial to pick a sustainable split program based on your daily activities. Picking a 6-days a week PPL split when you're just starting out and having a 9am-9pm job is certainly not a very good idea, as you will end up burnt out and breaking your commitment way too quickly. Start things out slowly (for example a 2-day a week U/L split), then slowly build your commitment up to the desired level (4-day U/L or 6-day PPL or 5-day Bro Split - that is, IF you want to). Also, remember to switch things up every now and then. Performing the same workouts and the same split for more than three months could hinder muscular growth. Most importantly, remember to keep your food intake on point, which I will be talking about in the Diet section. Without proper nutrition, your time in the gym may all be completely wasted.\"}");
