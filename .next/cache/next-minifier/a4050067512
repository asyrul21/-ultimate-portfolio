The project was well out of my degree\\'s syllabus scope, as it covered various concepts such as multi-threading, parallel-processing, electrical signals and Single Board Computers.

The Interpolation Program then takes this signal file to produce electrical pulses that drives the CNC machine to move a pen attached to it and draw the digital image on a piece of paper.\",\"technology\":\"The execution of this project exposed myself to an extensive amount of linux commands, since Raspberry Pi runs the Raspbian OS, which is based on Linux. I also did all developments on a seperate machine running Linux Debian. Development wise, the two programs were written heavily in C++/C++11. Parallel processing and multi-threading had to be implemented as signals need to be generated concurrently to the CNC machine\\'s servo motors. I was also exposed to various Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) softwares, such as AutoCAD and PyCAM respectively.\",\"results\":\"The end product of this project opened my eyes to the power of Software Engineering, as those two programs I wrote actually drove the CNC machine to draw images on a piece of paper.
