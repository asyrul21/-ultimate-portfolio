        "text": "As you have already seen from my transformations throughout the past years, I have indeed gone through a few times during which I incorporated various different fat-loss programs to help me get rid of my body fat. Besides helping you to look leaner and better, fat-loss programs train your mind, you patience, and of course, your cooking skills (because abs are made in the kitchen arn't they?). Moreover, becoming lean helps you run better, gain better endurance, and become a generally healthier person. Now I have heard countless of times people saying they want to start 'cutting' or lose fat, but just after 2 weeks of commitment, they gave up. Why? 1) They do not practice proper nutrition. 2) They got too excited and trained too hard in the beginning. 3) They simply do not know how to do it, and they refuse to seek knowledge. As mentioned, an effective cut requires perserverance, patience, discipline, humility in knowledge and will. Without any of these, not a single Fat Burner pill will be able to help you to lose fat."

        "title": "Key Concepts",
        "text": "There is only one primary objective of any fat-loss program, that is to bring the athlete's heart rate up, and then keep it there. How? By either raising it up higher though anarobic exercises, or keep them at a particular rate through aerobic exercises. Depending on your circumstances, you may need to apply different approaches towards selecting your fat-loss workouts. For example, it does not make sense if you have just completed a 90-minute intense leg day and after that going for a HIIT workout. In that case, you are better off with a steady state cardio (SSC) either to warm down, or to keep your heart rate at a certain level. Right, so how do we know that we are doing a good job during a fat-loss training? A good sign of when your heart rate is increasing is that you are panting to get more oxygen into the body. Secondly, you are sweating like you are taking a shower (as you 'burn' fat, it is catabolised into water - in the form of sweat and urine - and energy). Hence, if you plan to torch fat but your workout sessions barely make you sweat, you would not make any progress. In this page we will look at four of my favourite and go-to's fat-loss programs; the High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), High Intensity Cardio, Circuits and the Barbell Complex."

        "text": "The High Intensit Interval Training (HIIT), involves the idea of 'intervals' to raise the heart rate of the athlete. The intervals are often written as n:m, where n is the time given to work, and m is time given to rest. For example, a 1:4 running interval training on the treadmill would require the athlete to run for 1 minute and rest (slow down or walk) for 4 minutes. This interval is then repeated for a specific number of sets, usually 8-10 but as manay as you want. To increase intensity, you can change this interval ratio. 1:1 would be more challenging than 1:4 due to the lower rest time, and 2:1 would definitely the most challenging than the other two. For me, I like to mix up my intervals - for warm ups, for work sets, and for super work sets. You can perform HIIT with a wide range of exercises, although my two favourites are treadmill and stationary bike. Some suggestions on how to arrange your HIIT workout are as below:"

        "title": "High Intensity Cardio",
        "text": "The High Intensity Cardio is simply something that I came up with as I was training to lose fat. It is essentially steady state cardio, but done with maximum effort. Besides burning fat, the High Intensity Cardio helped me substantially with my endurance, especially in long distance running. I mostly do it outdoors, as viewing the scenery around my neighbourhood was effective in helping me relax and getting me off the stress of the busy city lifestyle. This workout is best done if you have a Fitness or a timer app which could give you a summary of your performance - such as your speed per km and your average heart rate - at the end of your workout. To do this workout, all you need to do is perform some light warm ups for 5-10mins and set yourself a distance for which you would like to run. In my experience, 5KM got me a good balance between intensity and endurance. Once you have decided how long to run, try to run at maximum effort, to get your best timing. Besides running, you can also perform High Intensity Cardio with a bicycle or while Swimming."

    "circuits": {
        "title": "Circuit Training",
        "link": "https://www.shape.com/fitness/workouts/how-build-perfect-circuit-workout",
        "text": "If you are not one of those people who enjoy running too much, another convenient option for fat-loss workouts are circuits. Circuits can be done at home or at the gym, with or without equipment, which make them very versatile and flexible. There is no one best way of designing circuits, hence it is always nice to nit-pick the circuits that best suit your own capabilities and capacity. In fact, I will give you some tips on how to create your own circuits, the one that you may feel most comfortable doing. Just like the other fat-loss workouts, we aim to increase the heart rate of the athlete, and make it stay there. That is, to ensure that you are tired, panting for oxygen, and sweating like a mad dog by the end of the workout. Circuits consist of a combination of workouts, which may or may not involve equipments. These workouts are executed in such a way that one workout is done after on another with little or no rest in between. When you switch workouts, you are basically giving the body part that was worked in the previous workout a chance to rest and recover. Therefore, in a circuit, workouts for different parts of the body are arranged alternating of each other, to allow the athlete to keep doing the workouts with minimal rest in between them. For example, the first workout is Squats for 20 reps, then the second workout usually works something else other than the legs, since Squats already done so. Let's say, for the second workout you chose pushups for 10 reps. While you are doing pushups, your legs are being rested, and hence in the third workout you can either go back to legs or do something else. That's it! After each circuit, the athlete may rest 1-2 minutes, and then the whole circuit is repeated 3-5 times. Some circuit suggestions are as depicted below. For warmups you can do 1-2 sets of light workouts such as Squats for 10 reps and/or pushups for 10 reps. Remeber to incorporate workouts such as Jump Jacks, Jump Squats, Mountain Climbers etc. in your circuits as well!"

        "text": "Finally, the Barbell Complex is basically a type of circuit, the only difference is that you will be using a barbell throughout the circuit. You can use any barbell, although the full-sized olympic barbell is preferred. Some programs require to not put the bar down at all throughout the movement, but up to you really, as long as you get the reps done. In any barbell complex, you need to preferably use a weighted barbell, which allows to execute the workouts with lesser repetitions. Depending on the load, you may vary the reps for each workout between 6 to 10. Like circuits, there are many available complexes out there, and you can design your own as well, based on the bopy parts you would like to put emphasis on. Below are some of the complexes that I have tried."

    "closure": "Since burning fat do take time and requires true commitment to be effective, it is essential that you keep changing things up and trying new things to achieve the same goal. Remember, all we want to do is to get that heart rate up, feel tired and sweat, consistently and effectively. Fat burning does NOT have to be boring and daunting. Thus, besides the programs and workouts explained in this page, you can also include other activities in your fat-loss routine: such as playing sports, soccer, basketball, swimming, going on a hike, stairs-marathon, etc. All of these activities achieve the same goal, provided you participate well and give your best. Typically in my experience, you could lose fat (down to the point of visible abs) in around 12-16 weeks. Therefore, it is important to pick programs and workouts that do not bore you just after 2 weeks. Variety is one of the keys to consistency. Most importantly, have fun! Have fun running faster, have fun gaining endurance, and have fun shredding off fat from that body!"
