    "title": "My Fitness Transformation",
    "time": "2012-2018",
    "intro": "Like many teenagers out there, I had the skinny-fat type of body. I was weak, have never exceled in any athletic event or sport, and finally injured myself as I twisted my knee during house practice at school when I was just 13 years old. This was probably due to my highly-inactive lifestyle, besides also being born in a family which do not practice physical exercise as weekly (even monthly) routines. That gradually changed after I was introduced to my brother in law, Dr. Daniel, who occasionally would invite me to join him for runs. At that time, 1 mile/1.5KM was enough to kill me. You can see Dr. Daniel in the photo below wearing red jersey. As I established myself with some stable allowances, I signed up for a gym and began my journey of knowledge.",
    "main1": "Throughout the years, I have tried various fitness programs ranging from endurance, strength and hypertrophy. However, my primary interest is mainly on hypertrophy training. These photos you see below did not take three or even six months of commitment, but a few years. Some say that fitness is a journey, not a destination - setting yourself a 3-month time frame to achieve a goal which in reality takes many years of training will essentially get you nowhere.",
    "main2": "To tell you that I figured out how to properly build muscle and burn fat on day 1 of training is definitely going to be a lie. It took me around 2-3 years to finally understand how the human body works, in regards with muscular development and fat catabolism. The photos you see below depict my physical tranformation over the past years, as I proved time and time again that my fat loss methodology worked. No drugs, just knowledge and willpower.",
    "maintenance": "As part of my effort to maintain the muscle mass I have naturally attained over the years, I normally hit the gym around 2-3 times a week. Most men would agree that the after-marriage phase of life is normally the most challenging when it comes to staying in shape, yet alone keeping up with the intense training schedules. Nevertheless, I managed to stay disciplined even after I got married, well at least for a couple of months, after which my goals in life gradually changed as I became older and more matured.",
    "closure": "As the days go by, my fitness goals slowly shifted from 'get big and strong' to just 'stay fit and healthy', which to me, serves a much healthier purpose in other aspects of life, those of which I have sacrificed for many years, such as family and friends relationship, travelling the world, and of course, improving my competency as a life-long software engineer. That being said, with the knowledge and experience I have gained over the years, if I ever feel like I am 'out-of-shape' I am 120% confident that I can always train and get myself back into shape."
